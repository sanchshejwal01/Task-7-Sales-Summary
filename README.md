## ðŸ§ª What the Script Does

1. Connects to `sales_data.db`
2. Executes a SQL query to calculate:
   - Total quantity sold per product
   - Total revenue per product
3. Loads results into a DataFrame
4. Prints the summary using `print()`
5. Visualizes revenue using a bar chart (saved as `sales_chart.png`)

### ðŸ“Š Sample SQL Query Used

```sql
SELECT 
    product, 
    SUM(quantity) AS total_qty, 
    SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue 
FROM sales 
GROUP BY product;
